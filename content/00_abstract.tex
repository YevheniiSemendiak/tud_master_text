\section*{Abstract}
The importance of exploration and exploitation balance plays a settle role while solving the combinatorial optimization problems. This balance is reached by two general techniques: by using a different problem solvers and by setting its proper parameters. Both problems were studied widely in past and the process is not finished up until now. The state-of-the-art studies in field of automated machine learning propose merging both problems, solving them at the design time and later strengthening the results in the run time. To the best of our knowledge, the \emph{generalized} approach for solving the parameter setting in heuristic solvers was not proposed yet. Therefore, the concept of merging heuristic selection and parameter control was not introduced.

In this thesis we propose an approach for generic parameter control in meta-heuristics by means of reinforcement learning (RL). Making step further, we propose a technique for merging the heuristic selection and parameter control problems and solving them in runtime using RL-based hyper-heuristic. The evaluation of proposed parameter control technique on symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) revealed its applicability by reaching the performance tuned in off-line underlying meta-heuristic. The concept of merging the heuristic selection and parameter control processes showed its ability to reach a performance of the best underling heuristic with tuned parameters on a subset of smaller TSP instances, however, requires an implementation improvements for tackling a larger cases.
