\section*{Abstract}
The importance of balance between exploration and exploitation plays a crucial role while solving combinatorial optimization problems. This balance is reached by two general techniques: by using an appropriate problem solver and by setting its proper parameters. Both problems were widely studied in the past and the research process continues up until now. The latest studies in the field of automated machine learning propose merging both problems, solving them at design time and later strengthening the results at runtime. To the best of our knowledge, the \emph{generalized} approach for solving the parameter setting problem in heuristic solvers has not yet been proposed. Therefore, the concept of merging heuristic selection and parameter control has not been introduced.

In this thesis we propose an approach for generic parameter control in meta-heuristics by means of reinforcement learning (RL). Making a step further, we suggest a technique for merging the heuristic selection and parameter control problems and solving them at runtime using RL-based hyper-heuristic. The evaluation of the proposed parameter control technique on a symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) revealed its applicability by reaching the performance of tuned in offline and used in isolation underlying meta-heuristic. Our approach provides the results on par with the best underlying heuristics with tuned parameters.
