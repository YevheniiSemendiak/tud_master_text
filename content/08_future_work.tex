\chapter{Future work}
\paragraph{add more sophisticated models}
\paragraph{dependencies / constraints in search space}
\paragraph{add new class of problem (jmetalpy easly allows it)}
\paragraph{evaluation on different types and classes}
\paragraph{adaptive time for tasks}
\paragraph{bounding LLH by number of evaluations, not time}
\paragraph{interesting direction: apply to automatic machine learning problems solving, compare to auto-sklearn.}
