\paragraph{Hyper-Heuristics with parameter tuning (or better say, control?), Constrainted Parameter Tuning and Architecture search problems all are the same?}
All these problems are seems to talk about the same thing, and trying to solve it in the same ways, while calling it differently. In one hand, it could be the result of relatively young research direction (in all cases). In other hand we could make such an assumption because knowledge lack $\smile$.

Hyper-Heuristics and Automatic Machine Learning are the same.
