\section{Considered approaches}
Approaches to derive an information about configurations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item "SPIRE" or heuristics (IRACE approach, all possible combinations are defined beforehand)
  \item switching (from one to another, which switch is better)
  \item picking (just, "run this particular heuristic now")
\end{itemize}
	
\section{What is the problem with the Search Space?}
\todoy{unofficial style? (not much, but at least to make some statements / headers catchy)}

- tree-shaped search space

- heterogeneous data

- different algorithms (model) to traverse and optimize such a search space could require different information

-- generality 

- top-down approach of optimization

-- different views of same Configuration (level-dependent) - filtering, transformation

-- problem features to consider while selecting meta-heuristic \cite{surv:kerschke2019automated} page 6
