\chapter{Concept description}
	\todor{It is your concept section, do not put related work here. How do you solve a defined problem?}

\section{Considered approaches}
Approaches to derive an information about configurations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item "SPIRE" or heuristics (IRACE approach, all possible combinations are defined beforehand)
  \item switching (from one to another, which switch is better)
  \item picking (just, "run this particular heuristic now")
\end{itemize}
	
\section{What is the problem with the Search Space?}
\todoy{unofficial style? (not much, but at least to make some statements / headers catchy)}
\todor{why is search space important? it just appears without an explanation}

- tree-shaped search space

- heterogeneous data

- different algorithms (model) to traverse and optimize such a search space could require different information

-- generality 

- top-down approach of optimization

-- different views of same Configuration (level-dependent) - filtering, transformation

-- problem features to consider while selecting meta-heuristic \cite{surv:kerschke2019automated} page 6
