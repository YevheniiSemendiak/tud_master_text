\chapter{Background}
\todor{add important terminology for parameter tuning}
one-two sentence definition of 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Heuristic
  \item Meta-heuristic
  \item Hybrid-heuristic
  \item Hyper-heuristic
\end{itemize}

\section{Meta-heuristics}
\subsection{Classification}

- from the solution point of view (construction / perturbation)

- solution availability (any-time / till the end)
     
\subsection{Related meta-heuristics description}
\todor{what does related mean? why did you choose exactly these 3(4) heuristics to be described? is there sth special the reader should know about them?}
- GA

- SA

- ES

- would be cool to add VNS
  
\section{Hybrid meta-heuristics and hyper-heuristics}
\subsection{Classification of hyper-heuristics}
- heuristic selection

- heuristic generation

- on-line learning hyper-heuristics

- off-line learning hyper-heuristics

- no-learning hyper-heuristics


\section{Scope of work defined}
\todor{consider emphasizing the problem here. show, how do these algorithm perform with the problem you try to solve. Save a detailed explanation of TSP, etc. for later. But make a vivid example why single MHs are under-performing.}
- on-line selection out of GA, SA, ES, parameter optimization to solve defined problem
\todor{shouldn't you first introduce parameter optimization to make such a conclusion?}
