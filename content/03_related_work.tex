utilize surveys

Previously reviewed systems that could be refereed in Related Work: \cite{surv:kerschke2019automated}
\section{AUTO-SKLEARN}
- CASH (Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization) problem
- pros and cons (on-line or off-line, problems to solve, extensibility)
- \cite{autosklearn:feurer2015efficient}

\section{BOHB}
- possible to try, but model will be lost in 'holes' of search space (no tree structure)
- should i cite it at all? (probably, it is not really relevant, since BOHB - Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale)

\section{IRACE}
- approach \cite{irace:lopez2016irace}
- off-line tuning
- is it really relevant?

\todor{BRISE?}
